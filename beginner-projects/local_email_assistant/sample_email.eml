Subject: Meeting Follow-up

Hi there,

Thank you for attending the project sync-up meeting today.  
I just wanted to recap a few action points we discussed:

- Finalize the draft report by Friday.
- Review the budget estimates.
- Schedule a follow-up call next Tuesday.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any help.

Best regards,  
Alice
