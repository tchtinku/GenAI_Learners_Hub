Hi Bob,

Hope youâ€™re doing well.

I wanted to follow up on the status of the Data Pipeline Revamp project. Could you please share:
- Current progress
- Any blockers youâ€™re facing
- An updated ETA for Phase 1 delivery

Letâ€™s ensure weâ€™re on track for the client review next Friday.

Thanks,
Alice

Hi Alice,

Thanks for checking in.

Progress:
âœ… Data ingestion module refactored
âœ… Unit tests at 85% coverage
ðŸ•’ ETL orchestration redesign in progress

Blockers:
- Waiting for DevOps team to provision the new staging environment.
- Need clarifications on data retention policy from Compliance.

ETA for Phase 1:
I estimate weâ€™ll need 3 more working days after the staging env is ready.

Please let me know if youâ€™d like to discuss this in tomorrowâ€™s standup.

Best,
Bob
